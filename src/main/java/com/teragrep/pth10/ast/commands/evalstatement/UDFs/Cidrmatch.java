 * User Defined Function for command cidrmatch(ip, subnet)<br><br>
 * Assumes that both ip and subnet are in String format, and returns a boolean.<br>
 * Returns TRUE, if the ip belongs to the subnet given. Otherwise returns FALSE.<br>
 * Expects subnet to be in CIDR form. Like 192.168.1.1/24. Where the number after / is the netmask length in bits.<br><br>
